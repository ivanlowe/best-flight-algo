# 1. Get and mark locations of 5 - 10 major cities in the world (where you can easily gets their main English
# newspaper online) from Kuala Lumpur.
# 2. Get the distances between these cities
# 3. Using one of the algorithms for shortest path, get the minimum distance to travel to the destination from
# Kuala Lumpur by transiting 2-3 cities.
# 4. Plot line between the cities before and after the algorithm chosen.
# 5. Extract from the English newspaper of the cities of webpages text and count the number of words in the
# webpages.
# 6. Plot line/scatter/histogram graphs related to the word count using Plotly (Word count, stop words)
# 7. Compare words in the webpages with the positive, negative and neutral English words using a String
# Matching algorithm
# 8. Plot histogram graphs of positive and negative words found in the webpages.
# 9. Give an algorithmic conclusion regarding the sentiment of those articles
# 10. Lastly, calculate the total probability distribution of random routes taken for the end user to travel
# from Kuala Lumpur to other country.
